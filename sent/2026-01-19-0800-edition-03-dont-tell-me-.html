            <p>When it comes to weekly strategic goals, ‘I was busy’ isn’t a get-out-of-jail-free card.</p>

<p>Sure, urgent work hits us from every direction.</p>

<p>But that doesn’t absolve us, as leaders, from focusing on our big-picture priorities.</p>

<p>At the same time, we shouldn’t feel ashamed or beat ourselves up.</p>

<p>It takes time to build strong strategy-execution habits.</p>

<p>We can’t simply decide to have better focus, just like we can’t snap our fingers and become physically strong.</p>

<p>To get strong, you have to go to the gym for a while.</p>

<p>And even once you’ve built your muscles, you have to keep going to keep them.</p>

<p>Strategy execution habits are the same way.</p>

<p>Over time, you can build the strength to stay strategic in the face of all the distractions.</p>

<p>Set weekly goals, block time for them, and do your best to follow through.</p>

<p>It won’t be perfect.</p>

<p>Have grace for yourself as you build your discipline.</p>

<p>In time, you’ll master the art of strategy execution despite the daily whirlwind.</p>

            ☐ <b>Pause</b> to remember what your big goals are (don't skip this!).
            <br>☐ <b>Review</b> your actions from <i>last</i> week (done? not done?).
            <br>☐ <b>Decide</b> what actions you'll take <i>this</i> week (specific and measurable).
            <br>☐ <b>Schedule</b> the work in your calendar (time blocking).
