            <p>In a growing company, ‘sitting in the shade’ simply means the business is fundamentally stronger than it once was.</p>

<p>It means that you have better problems than you used to have.</p>

<p>It means that what is possible for you and your team has expanded because the foundation you’ve laid is stronger and deeper.</p>

<p>So what does it actually look like to ‘plant trees’ for your company?</p>

<p>Set yearly goals.</p>

<p>Break them down to quarterly and monthly milestones.</p>

<p>Take weekly action toward them.</p>

<p>Those weekly steps are the seeds that will grow into shade trees for you, your leaders, and the whole business.</p>

<p>Your business can be in a far better place next quarter, next year, next decade.</p>

<p>But you have to escape the trap of short-term-ism.</p>

<p>You have to plant the seeds this week.</p>

            ☐ <b>Pause</b> to remember what your big goals are (don't skip this!).
            <br>☐ <b>Review</b> your actions from <i>last</i> week (done? not done?).
            <br>☐ <b>Decide</b> what actions you'll take <i>this</i> week (specific and measurable).
            <br>☐ <b>Schedule</b> the work in your calendar (time blocking).

            <p><i>Now, you're set to win.</i> 👍
