## The Quote

"Exceptional founders have the ability to think long term, even while sprinting to stay alive."

— Pete Flint, Founder and Investor


## The Coaching

Investing in big-picture projects while you scramble to hold everything together in the short term is tough.

But you don't have to be some magically gifted "exceptional" leader to do it.

The key is to systematically identify your strategic priorities, break them down to actionable steps, and build a routine that helps you carve out the time to focus on doing that bigger picture work every week, no matter what.

With practice, you can build the habits that make you exceptional.

## Subject: 🕗 Plan your week // Even rock stars need process 🎸


## The Quote

"You can only go so far without process."

— Bono, Actual Rock Star, U2


## The Coaching

The quote itself isn't a huge insight.

What's interesting is who said it: Bono, one of the most prolific creatives on the planet; an artist to the core; someone we could imagine seeing process as a constraint on his creativity.

If Bono acknowledges the importance of process, so should we.

If you're someone who likes process, be careful not to be a slave to it.

If you're someone who feels constrained by process, be careful not to be a slave to your freedom.

Pick a goal execution process, and stick with it even when you don't feel like it.

After all, structure may limit our freedom in the moment, but it frees us to accomplish what we actually want to achieve.

Big goals take time.

If you over-index on getting results, you'll get discouraged before they results have a chance to come.

Break your goals down into small actions.

Measure yourself on completing those small actions—that's your trajectory.

But that’s not enough.

You also have to be *consistent*.

To go far, you have to walk in the same direction for a long time.

Willpower alone isn’t enough to carry you over the long haul.

You need structured support and accountability.

🕗 Plan your week // Big rocks first 🪨


## The Quote

"If you don't put the big rocks in first, you'll never get them in at all."

— Stephen R. Covey


## The Coaching

If you just go with the flow, small stuff will fill your time. Your most impactful work will get crowded out completely.

You need to schedule your "big rocks" (strategic objectives) into your week and let the smaller stuff fill in the time around them. 

That's the only way to ensure that you get the important stuff done.

However: there are two aspects to "putting the big rocks in first".

First, it means planning your week on Monday (or earlier).

Second, it means scheduling time blocks for your most strategic work **earlier in the week rather than later.**

Because, as I often say...



* Friday is where **weekly** goals go to die.
* The last week of the month is where **monthly** goals go to die.
* And the last month of the quarter is where **quarterly** goals go to die.

I know you feel crazy busy. But truly: **you have enough time to do what's necessary.**

As long as you a) plan your week on Monday and b) schedule your strategic work earlier than later in the week.

It is a commitment to reflect and learn from your misses without recasting them as successes.

## The Quote

"What's the **one thing** you can do such that by doing it, **everything else** will be **easier or unnecessary**?"

*— Gary Keller*


## The Coaching

Are the actions you have planned for this week "low leverage" or "high leverage"?

**Low leverage** actions give you a 1:1 return on your energy. The effort and the impact are roughly equal. They are well understood and routine. For example, ops meetings, clearing your inbox, admin tasks, etc.

**High leverage** actions deliver a much higher return on your energy (ideally 10X or more). These are strategic projects that make things better forever. They solve problems at the category level, not just one instance at a time. They break the company through to a new level of opportunity.

Of course, you can’t eliminate low leverage tasks.

However, growing as a strategic leader means shifting your emphasis to high leverage work.

## The Coaching

To be honest, I don't like this quote.

I have a bit of intelligence and a dash of charisma.

And I am constantly tempted to rely on them instead of discipline.

Instead of just sticking to a few simple things over time, I look for the "smarter" (a.k.a. easier) way.

I get distracted by finding complete, perfect, definitive solutions instead of grinding away on an approach that is "good enough".

I want the problems in my business to be fixed today, not "over time". 

Ironically, this weakness for immediate results tends to delay the solution.

Maybe you can identify?

To be clear, ambitious goals are important. By all means, we should act with courage so as to not waste time.

But in our efforts to move quickly, we should *also* keep grinding away.

Write down your desperate plan to achieve the goal on time.

Your first ideas might feel overwhelming — they’ll demand too much sacrifice.

Keep writing more ideas.

Often, before too long, you’ll hit on an idea or two that are actually not *that* extreme — things you could actually try without sacrificing everything else.

## The Quote

"If you ignore the *urgent*, it can kill you **today**. If you ignore the *important*, it can **kill you tomorrow**."

*— The 4 Disciplines of Execution*


## The Coaching

We’re wired to feel stressed when demands pile up on our time and attention. We instinctively jump to fix whatever’s burning right now.

But when it comes to longer-term strategic work — even if it promises big impact — we rarely react with the same intensity. Why? Because the payoff is months or years away. 

**When we’re pressed, it is tempting to push strategic work to another day — even though that behavior will kill your company in the long term.**

For all of us, there’s a never-ending battle between what’s *urgent* and what’s *important*.

My recommendation? *Don’t fight the battle.*

Instead, make weekly deadlines for yourself to complete small strategic tasks that connect to longer-term important goals. 

Ask your team (or others in your life) for accountability to complete those weekly commitments.

This makes strategic work feel more urgent — and helps you overcome the pull of short-termism.

Chances are, the goals in your head are probably more muddled than you realize.

And your daily tasks probably don’t fully align with your long-term goals.

How do I know?

Because you’re a human.

We generally overestimate how clearly we understand ourselves and our goals.

That’s why writing out your goals along with a simple explanation for why they are the *right* goals is so useful. It forces you to think more deeply and get clear on what you’re doing and why.

It's the fastest way to double your clarity on what you’re all about.

## **The Quote**


## "The biggest risk to productivity is always the same: **working on the wrong thing.**"


## *— James Clear*


## **The Coaching**

No amount of hustle will help if you’re working on the wrong thing. It is so easy to plunge into one task after another as they come up. We need to slow down, breathe, review the bigger picture, and double-check that our tasks align with our goals.

On the other hand, **the second biggest risk to productivity is overthinking.** *“Action begets clarity.”* Often, getting started reveals more than more analysis ever will. Constantly second-guessing ourselves keeps us chasing our tails.

I recommend you schedule at least an hour of reflection early in each week. Then, for the rest of the week, prioritize execution. Even if you start to wonder if you’re working on the right things, keep going. Don’t second-guess. You can course-correct in your next reflection time.

**This approach keeps you working on the right things, without falling into the trap of overthinking.**

The point they’re both making is that if we wait to do important work until we feel inspired, our progress will be sporadic. We’ll struggle to put in the hours necessary to succeed. We really do need to sit down and get to work regardless of how we feel.

**But that doesn’t mean we should power through like robots and ignore our need for inspiration.**

It just means that we need to *get started* even if we aren’t feeling it.

Getting started usually kickstarts our internal momentum. **We start to feel inspired *after* we start the work.**

The trick is to make the very first step scripted and mechanical and easy. For example, I often don’t feel like writing, but I have a document with links to the 7 browser tabs I need open when I write an article. When I’m feeling the resistance, I just say to myself, “Just open the tabs”.

Once I do that, I usually feel a twinge of motivation. And before I know it, I’m writing and I’m not even thinking about whether I’m feeling inspired (which means I am).

In short: discipline yourself to regularly get started on your most important work no matter how you feel, trusting that inspiration will arrive to carry you on.

🕗 Plan your week // Bad systems beat good people 🤔


## The Quote

"A bad system will beat a good person every time."

*— Edwards Deming*


## The Coaching

When you get disappointing results from someone on your team, it is easy to suspect a character flaw. It feels like they should have done better.

We treat ourselves the same way. When we fall short on something, we feel like it reflects poorly on our discipline, our level of organization, or our abilities.

When you feel disappointed in yourself or someone else, slow down and take a moment to check the system. Often, a flawed system is to blame, not the person.

**The most common flaw? Relying on willpower and memory instead of building automation and habits.**

For example, leaders set strategic goals for themselves and their team but stop there. The weekly execution of those goals depends on everyone remembering them and mustering the willpower to work on them. Without a proper system, everyone finds it hard to stay goal-focused.

If you want consistent performance, invest in optimizing the system with automation and habit formation so that it requires as little willpower and memory as possible.

**Good people with a good system are unstoppable.**

🕗 Plan your week // How to pick "right" habits 🐥


## The Quote

"There’s nothing you can’t do if you get the habits right."

— Charles Duhigg


## The Coaching

“Getting the habits” right sounds simple—but it's anything but.

I recommend you start with the *size* of the habit. Identify what you want to start doing, then create a smaller habit that supports it.

For example, let’s say you want to start working on your strategic goals more (not just daily work). You decide to shoot for 4 hours of strategic work per week. **Don’t set that as your target.**

Set two smaller habits instead:



1. At the beginning of the week, schedule 4 hours of strategic work on your calendar.
2. Track the number of strategic work hours you actually do.

You’re far more likely to follow through with these two smaller habits. 

And they will end up building the bigger habit over time.

The “right” habits are usually small and easy.

🕗 Plan your week // Refuse to fail ⛰


## The Quote

"Reasonable expectations return mediocre results."

*— Kieran Ryan*


## The Coaching

“Wow, this goal turned out easier than I expected!”, said no one, ever. 🚫

Goals *always* turn out to be more complex and challenging than they first appear, and you always get sucked into other things and fall behind.

When a goal proves tougher than expected and your confidence dips, the “reasonable” response is to accept the delay.

**This is when I want you to become *unreasonable. *Refuse to fail*.***

I’m not saying you should kill yourself with work or ruin your team culture to get things done. I’m just challenging you to not give in at the first sign of trouble.

Dig deep. Win through creativity, boldness, and consistency. Apply a *touch* of brute force (not enough to hurt yourself).

When your “Plan A” doesn’t work out, ask yourself:



* What could be my plan B, C, D, and E?
* If I absolutely *had to achieve this*, what would I do?

Spend 30 minutes brainstorming bold, unconventional routes to success.

Get a little unreasonable, and you'll often find a way.

🕗 Plan your week // Result goals or action goals? 🕺


## **The Quote**


## "You don't get results by focusing on results. You get results by focusing on the actions that produce results."


## *— Mike Hawkins*


## **The Coaching**

Result-oriented goals like ‘Hit $50 M in revenue’ are fine for establishing the *scale* of what you’re up to.

But they are useless on their own. 

You need to break the result-oriented goals down into sub-goals that are **action oriented**.

Hold yourself accountable to completing the jobs you committed to do.

Sometimes you’ll nail the action but still miss the result.

Occasionally, luck delivers the result even if you fall short on the action.

Don’t let those edge cases distract you.

Over time, disciplined ***action*** wins.

🕗 Plan your week // Micro-management vs. Micro-accountability 🔬


## The Quote

"Micromanagement is the destroyer of momentum."

*— Miles Anthony Smith*


## The Coaching

Let’s be clear: micromanagement isn’t evil. Sometimes it’s necessary. However, it’s not ideal because it frustrates people and slows progress.

But, too often, leaders swing the other way and fail to manage their teams effectively. The balance between micromanagement on one side and abdication on the other is **micro-accountability**.

People set their own monthly milestones. They’re in control of deciding on the weekly tasks that support those milestones. But they are expected to document them, make them measurable, and track their wins and losses.

You don’t tell them exactly what to do; you just ask them to operate in a transparent way.

And, of course, this goes for how you lead yourself as well. 

Hold yourself accountable to do the small things well, and the big wins will follow.

🕗 Plan your week // Want it now or want it most? 🐘


## **The Quote**

"Discipline is choosing between what you want **now** and what you want **most**."

*— Abraham Lincoln*


## **The Coaching**

This quote from Abraham Lincoln hits me hard, because I know that, at least in some small way, I choose what I want *now* at the expense of what I want *most* every single day.

I want to achieve the yearly goals I have for HabitStack, but right now, I want to read Hacker News. I want to be a wonderful husband and father, but right now, I want to lie on the couch. I want to keep playing basketball until I’m 65, but right now, I want a cookie.

Why do I trade future joy for immediate but small pleasures? Is it just laziness?

That’s part of it, but not all of it. It's also that immediate gratification is *certain* and delayed gratification is only *probable*. If I stay disciplined, I will *probably* reap the rewards, but it is always possible that something unexpected happens and my efforts will be wasted.

“A bird in the hand is better than two in the bush” is a primal instinct.

Working on the future is a gamble. It's risky. It takes faith and mental toughness.

Here are some tactics to make it a bit easier to consistently play the long game:



1. Accountability to someone other than yourself helps pull you through when your motivation ebbs.
2. Find some way, even if it's small, to make strategic work fun. You’re not a robot who can just mechanically “do the right thing” without *any* joy in the short term.
3. Separate planning from execution. First, plan by chunking down your goals from the year to the quarter to the month to the week. Now, execute. When you have an hour to do strategic work it is WAY easier to get down to execution if you’re already crystal clear on what you need to do.

Discipline is how we build the businesses and the lives we really want.

## Number: **31 **


## NOTES:



* Considign shifting the tone of this one more towards just normalizing that we don’t have control of our goals.
* We should be careful not to set goals that are too far out of our control, but the reality is that all goals are ultimately not in our complete control. We depend on other people. We depend on our health. We depend on all kinds of things. And so don't get into the habit of thinking that we're off the hook just because it didn't happen because somebody else let us down. We need to find ways to get our goals done even though people have different priorities than ours and they don't always follow through the way we need and hope they do.

🕗 Plan your week // Dare to annoy 🏓


## **The Quote**


## "Effective goal execution requires you to take responsibility for things you have no business taking responsibility for."


## *— Scott Ward*


## **The Coaching**

Let’s not blame our missed goals on external factors. Other people have their own priorities, and they only partially align with ours.

Now, we can’t force people to do what we want them to do. We shouldn’t manipulate or bully others. Obviously, let’s stay kind and open-hearted and positive.

But we can do a lot better than saying, “I asked for what I needed and they didn’t get it to me on time”.

Ask again. Call them instead of sending another email. Dare to be slightly annoying in your persistence. Build a relationship. Help them understand what your goal means to you and the company. Visit them in person.

Dare to pull out all the stops when necessary.

Mental fatigue blurs priorities and stalls action on what matters most.

Stop and get everything out of your head by **writing it all down.**

🕗 Plan your week // Habits for scale 🔔


## **The Quote**


## "What got you here won't get you there."


## *— Marshall Goldsmith*


## **The Coaching**

As your business grows, so must your habits as a leader.

For example, there’s a certain set of habits that serve founders well as they grow their company from 0 to 1M in Annual Recurring Revenue. They need to be scrappy, intuitive, and execute key tasks directly.

A *different* set of habits is required from the founder and the leadership team to grow from 1M to 5M in ARR. They need to be strategizing longer-term, developing leaders, and establishing systems.

Clinging to outdated habits causes friction and holds the company back.

Are your habits driving growth or dragging you down? Ask your team. 😉
