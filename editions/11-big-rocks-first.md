If you just go with the flow, small stuff will fill your time. Your most impactful work will get crowded out completely.

You need to schedule your "big rocks" (strategic objectives) into your week and let the smaller stuff fill in the time around them.

That's the only way to ensure that you get the important stuff done.

However: there are two aspects to "putting the big rocks in first".

First, it means planning your week on Monday (or earlier).

Second, it means scheduling time blocks for your most strategic work **earlier in the week rather than later.**

Because, as I often say...

- Friday is where **weekly** goals go to die.
- The last week of the month is where **monthly** goals go to die.
- And the last month of the quarter is where **quarterly** goals go to die.

I know you feel crazy busy. But truly: **you have enough time to do what's necessary.**

As long as you a) plan your week on Monday and b) schedule your strategic work earlier than later in the week.
