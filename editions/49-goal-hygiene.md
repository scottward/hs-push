Big business goals are hard to hit.

You won’t hit them every time because plenty of factors are out of your control.

But don’t forget: you do control a lot.

For example, you can control your “goal hygiene”. In other words, follow the best-practices of goal achievement. Pay attention to the “proper care and feeding” of your goals.

Specifically, there are four habits that protect your goals from self-defeat:

\* FOCUS on a small number of meaningful goals.

\* CHUNK them down from the year → quarter → month → week.

\* TRACK the sub goals to understand real progress.

\* RATE your confidence regularly so you can adjust course as needed.

These practices help you avoid unforced errors.

Your goals will still be tough. But you’ll reduce unnecessary headwind.
