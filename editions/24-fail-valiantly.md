When a goal starts slipping, please, don't just accept the delay. Put up a fight!

Pause and ask yourself: _"What if achieving this goal was the only way to avoid something truly terrible? What if I acted as if **delaying this goal was not an option?**"_

Write down your desperate plan to achieve the goal on time.

Your first ideas might feel overwhelming — they'll demand too much sacrifice.

Keep writing more ideas.

Often, before too long, you'll hit on an idea or two that are actually not _that_ extreme — things you could actually try without sacrificing everything else.

With creativity and courage, you can get your goals back on track.

Even if you still miss the goal, at least **fail valiantly**.
