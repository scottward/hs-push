The quote itself isn't a huge insight.

What's interesting is who said it: **Bono** , one of the most prolific creatives on the planet; an artist to the core; someone we could imagine seeing process as a constraint on his creativity.

If Bono acknowledges the importance of process, so should we.

If you're someone who likes process, be careful not to be a slave to it.

If you're someone who feels constrained by process, be careful not to be a slave to your freedom.

Pick a goal execution process, and stick with it even when you don't feel like it.

After all, structure may limit our freedom in the moment, but it frees us to accomplish what we actually want to achieve.
