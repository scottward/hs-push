Consistently working on your bigger goals is hard.

Do not take hardness as evidence that something is wrong.

**Important things are always hard to finish.**

If absolutely necessary, scale down your strategic work this week, but always move your key priorities forward, even in a small way.

It’s supposed to be hard.

Stay the course.
