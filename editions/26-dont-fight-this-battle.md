We're wired to feel stressed when demands pile up on our time and attention. We instinctively jump to fix whatever's burning right now.

But when it comes to longer-term strategic work — even if it promises big impact — we rarely react with the same intensity. Why? Because the payoff is months or years away.

**When we're pressed, it is tempting to push strategic work to another day — even though that behavior will kill your company in the long term.**

For all of us, there's a never-ending battle between what's _urgent_ and what's _important_.

My recommendation? _Don't fight the battle._

Instead, make weekly deadlines for yourself to complete small strategic tasks that connect to longer-term important goals.

Ask your team (or others in your life) for accountability to complete those weekly commitments.

This makes strategic work feel more urgent — and helps you overcome the pull of short-termism.
