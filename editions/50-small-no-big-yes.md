Slow down for a second.

Read this carefully:

Focus. Is. Magic.

Pure leverage.

And, you’re wasting it.

How do I know?

Because 99.9% of people are trying to do too many things.

Focus requires courage, humility, and vigilance.

It is a habit that you build over time, not all at once.

What is one obligation or opportunity that you can let go of in order to focus more deeply on a goal that is more important?

Don’t say “everything is important” because that dooms your larger goals.

Let a small ‘no’ protect your bigger ‘yes’.
