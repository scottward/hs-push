Slowing down to reflect on the bigger picture is an underrated productivity hack because it helps you _work on the right things._

- What are your goals for the year, quarter, and month?
- Are they still right?
- What progress must you make this week to stay on track?
- What can you give yourself permission to _not_ do so you can focus on what matters most?

These aren’t fancy questions.

They’ll only take you a handful of minutes to contemplate.

But they’ll save you loads of time by keeping you focused in the right direction.
