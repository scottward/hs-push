Your goals represent **gains**.

Most of your todos relate to **losses** you want to avoid. That's why they feel urgent.

Recognize that you are hard-wired biologically to prioritize your "urgent" todos, at the expense of your larger goals.

Thankfully, you can adopt goal habits that reconfigure your instincts to prioritize what's important.

But you need to deliberately work on it.

See the habits below!
