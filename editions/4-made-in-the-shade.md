In a growing company, ‘sitting in the shade’ simply means the business is fundamentally stronger than it once was.

It means that you have better problems than you used to have.

It means that what is possible for you and your team has expanded because the foundation you've laid is stronger and deeper.

So what does it actually look like to ‘plant trees’ for your company?

Set yearly goals.

Break them down to quarterly and monthly milestones.

Take weekly action toward them.

Those weekly steps are the seeds that will grow into shade trees for you, your leaders, and the whole business.

Your business can be in a far better place next quarter, next year, next decade.

But you have to escape the trap of short-term-ism.

You have to plant the seeds this week.
