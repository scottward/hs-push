In the context of growing a company, “sitting in the shade” means the business is in a fundamentally stronger position than it was before.

It means that you have better problems than you used to have.

It means that what is _possible_ for you and your team has expanded because the foundation you’ve laid is stronger and deeper and taller.

What does it mean in practical terms to “plant trees”?

Set yearly goals.

Break them down to the quarterly and monthly milestones.

Take weekly action towards each.

Those weekly steps are the seeds that will grow into shade trees for you, your leaders, and the whole business.

Your business can be in a much better place next quarter, next year, next decade.

But you have to escape the trap of short-term-ism.

You have to plant the seeds this week.
