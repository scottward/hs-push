Any serious methodology for executing big goals will require you to pay attention to a lot of little details. HabitStack certainly does.

Write clear, measurable goals.

Document the “why” behind them.

Track your progress and communicate your confidence levels to your team.

Create an action plan and keep it up to date.

Plan your week.

Plan your day.

Time-block your strategic work.

All those little things can feel annoying. They can feel tedious. Boring.

But you’ve got to do them.

_The little things make the big things happen._
