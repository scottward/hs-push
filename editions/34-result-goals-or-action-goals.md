Result-oriented goals like 'Hit $50 M in revenue' are fine for establishing the _scale_ of what you're up to.

But they are useless on their own.

You need to break the result-oriented goals down into sub-goals that are **action oriented**.

Hold yourself accountable to completing the jobs you committed to do.

Sometimes you'll nail the action but still miss the result.

Occasionally, luck delivers the result even if you fall short on the action.

Don't let those edge cases distract you.

Over time, disciplined **_action_** wins.
