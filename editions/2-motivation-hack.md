We tend to focus on the gaps, the problems, the misses.

It's easy to overlook how much is going _right_.

One of the easiest ways to boost morale is to highlight something someone did well and say, “Nicely done!”

Recognition is surprisingly powerful.

You can also do the same thing for yourself.

Sometimes when I finish something, I’ll say out loud, “Way to go, Scotty!”

It's a little goofy, but it feels good.

Another great practice is to journal at the end of the day: “Today, one thing I did well was…”

I know you’re hustling to get things done.

Still, try to pause long enough to recognize your team. And yourself.

It helps.
