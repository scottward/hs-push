We tend to focus on the gaps, the problems, the misses.

It’s easy to forget that there’s always a lot going _right_ that deserves recognition.

When you lead a team, one of the easiest ways to boost morale is to just point at a specific thing that someone did well and say, “Nicely done!”.

It’s actually amazing how meaningful and motivating recognition is.

You can also do the same thing for yourself.

When I finish something, I’ll occasionally say out loud to myself, “Way to go, Scotty!”

It sounds goofy, but it feels pretty good.

Another great practice is to journal at the end of the day: “Today, one thing I did well was…”

I know you’re busy. I know you’re hustling to get things done.

All the same, try to slow down just enough to give a bit of recognition to your team and yourself.

It helps.
