When we’re pursuing a big goal, usually, our Plan A doesn’t end up working.

Often, Plan B doesn’t either.

At that point, it feels like “the writing is on the wall.”

We’re discouraged.

Full of doubt.

Time to give up.

Wrong.

It is _normal_ to lose multiple battles before you win the war.

Stay resourceful.

Try Plan C.

If that doesn’t work, go to Plan D, etc.

I know it's hard to keep trying after multiple setbacks.

Hopefully, knowing that it’s normal takes the edge off.

You can do it.

**Fortune favors the unreasonable.**
