When we're pursuing a big goal, Plan A usually doesn’t work.

Often, Plan B doesn't either.

At that point, it feels like the writing is on the wall.

We're discouraged.

Frustrated.

Beginning to admit defeat.

Stop right there.

It is normal to lose multiple battles before you win the war.

Stay resourceful.

Try Plan C.

If that doesn't work, go to Plan D, E, etc.

I know it's hard to keep trying after multiple setbacks.

Hopefully, knowing that it's normal takes the edge off.

You can do it.

Keep pushing.

**Fortune favors the unreasonable.**
