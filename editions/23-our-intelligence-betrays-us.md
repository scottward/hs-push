To be honest, I don't like this quote.

I have a bit of intelligence and a dash of charisma.

And I am constantly tempted to rely on them instead of discipline.

Instead of just sticking to a few simple things over time, I look for the "smarter" (a.k.a. easier) way.

I get distracted by finding complete, perfect, definitive solutions instead of grinding away on an approach that is "good enough".

I want the problems in my business to be fixed today, not "over time".

Ironically, this weakness for immediate results tends to delay the solution.

Maybe you can identify?

To be clear, ambitious goals are important. By all means, we should act with courage so as to not waste time.

But in our efforts to move quickly, we should _also_ keep grinding away.

We need to practice intelligent opportunism _and_ dumb repetition.
