When it comes to weekly strategic goals, ‘I was busy’ isn’t a get-out-of-jail-free card.

Sure, urgent work hits us from every direction.

But that doesn't absolve us, as leaders, from focusing on our big-picture priorities.

At the same time, we shouldn't feel ashamed or beat ourselves up.

It takes time to build strong strategy-execution habits.

We can’t simply decide to have better focus, just like we can’t snap our fingers and become physically strong.

To get strong, you have to go to the gym for a while.

And even once you’ve built your muscles, you have to keep going to keep them.

Strategy execution habits are the same way.

Over time, you can build the strength to stay strategic in the face of all the distractions.

Set weekly goals, block time for them, and do your best to follow through.

It won't be perfect.

Have grace for yourself as you build your discipline.

In time, you'll master the art of strategy execution despite the daily whirlwind.
