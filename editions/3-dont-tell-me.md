When it comes to working on strategic goals each week, “I was busy” shouldn’t be a “get out of jail free” card.

Sure, we have a lot of urgent work coming at us all the time. But that doesn’t absolve us of our responsibility as leaders to focus on big picture work.

However, we also shouldn’t feel ashamed and beat ourselves up.

We should feel humbled and thankful that we can try again next week to keep our priorities straight.

And we should recognize that self-improvement takes time.

We can’t just _decide_ to do better with our focus any more than we can just _decide_ to be physically strong.

You have to go to the gym for a while.

And then even after you are strong, you have to _keep_ going to maintain your strength.

Strategy execution habits are the same way.

Over time, you can build the strength to stay strategic in the face of all the distraction.

Set weekly goals, schedule them on your calendar, try your best to execute them.

It won’t be perfect.

But eventually, you’ll become excellent at strategy execution despite the whirlwind.

In short, “I’m too busy” doesn’t get us off the hook for doing the work we need to do.

Still, we should have grace for ourselves since it takes time to develop our discipline.
