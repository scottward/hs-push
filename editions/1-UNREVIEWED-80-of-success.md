When it comes to strategic goal execution, “Showing up” means:

1️⃣ Write down clear, measurable goals

2️⃣ Break those goals down into quarter → month → week

3️⃣ Explicitly set aside time to do your strategic work each week

None of these are actually _doing_ the work.

They are pre-requisites for being _able_ to take strategic action.

If and when you struggle to spend time on your big goals, get back to the basics.

Get back to showing up.
