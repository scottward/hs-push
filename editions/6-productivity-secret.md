What's the secret to working on the right thing?

Use a system that lets you reflect more deeply, but less often.

For goodness' sake don't leave the question, "What should I do now?" to an in-the-moment instinct that gets yanked around by your emotions.

Set an annual goal and break it down to the quarter and month.

Plan your week around your monthly priorities.

When the question 'What should I be doing right now?' comes to mind, do **not** pause to reflect.

Why? Because if you have to spend energy thinking about your next move, you're likely to skip to something routine. Or you'll get lost in analysis.

Don't think.

Just pull up your pre-planned weekly actions and get busy.
