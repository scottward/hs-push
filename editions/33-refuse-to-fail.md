"Wow, this goal turned out easier than I expected!", said no one, ever.

Goals _always_ turn out to be more complex and challenging than they first appear, and you always get sucked into other things and fall behind.

When a goal proves tougher than expected and your confidence dips, the "reasonable" response is to accept the delay.

**This is when I want you to become _unreasonable. Refuse to fail._**

I'm not saying you should kill yourself with work or ruin your team culture to get things done. I'm just challenging you to not give in at the first sign of trouble.

Dig deep. Win through creativity, boldness, and consistency. Apply a _touch_ of brute force (not enough to hurt yourself).

When your "Plan A" doesn't work out, ask yourself:

- What could be my plan B, C, D, and E?
- If I absolutely _had to achieve this_, what would I do?

Spend 30 minutes brainstorming bold, unconventional routes to success.

Get a little unreasonable, and you'll often find a way.
