Let’s be clear: micromanagement isn’t evil. Sometimes it’s necessary. However, it’s not ideal because it frustrates people and slows progress.

But, too often, leaders swing the other way and fail to manage their teams effectively. The balance between micromanagement on one side and abdication on the other is **micro-accountability**.

People set their own monthly milestones. They’re in control of deciding on the weekly tasks that support those milestones. But they are expected to document them, make them measurable, and track their wins and losses.

You don’t tell them exactly what to do; you just ask them to operate in a transparent way.

And, of course, this goes for how you lead yourself as well.

Hold yourself accountable to do the small things well, and the big wins will follow.
