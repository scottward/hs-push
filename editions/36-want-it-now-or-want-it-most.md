This quote from Abraham Lincoln hits me hard, because I know that, at least in some small way, I choose what I want _now_ at the expense of what I want _most_ every single day.

I want to achieve the yearly goals I have for HabitStack, but right now, I want to read Hacker News. I want to be a wonderful husband and father, but right now, I want to lie on the couch. I want to keep playing basketball until I'm 65, but right now, I want a cookie.

Why do I trade future joy for immediate but small pleasures? Is it just laziness?

That's part of it, but not all of it. It's also that immediate gratification is _certain_ and delayed gratification is only _probable_. If I stay disciplined, I will _probably_ reap the rewards, but it is always possible that something unexpected happens and my efforts will be wasted.

"A bird in the hand is better than two in the bush" is a primal instinct.

Working on the future is a gamble. It's risky. It takes faith and mental toughness.

Here are some tactics to make it a bit easier to consistently play the long game:

1. Accountability to someone other than yourself helps pull you through when your motivation ebbs.
2. Find some way, even if it's small, to make strategic work fun. You're not a robot who can just mechanically "do the right thing" without _any_ joy in the short term.
3. Separate planning from execution. First, plan by chunking down your goals from the year to the quarter to the month to the week. Now, execute. When you have an hour to do strategic work it is WAY easier to get down to execution if you're already crystal clear on what you need to do.

Discipline is how we build the businesses and the lives we really want.
