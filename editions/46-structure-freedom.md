The habit of time-blocking can increase your productivity by 50%. Crazy!

Structured habits can have a massive impact on what you accomplish.

And unlike so many other things, they’re fully within your control.

Structure might feel like it limits your freedom.

You can’t just do whatever you want, whenever you want.

But it also _gives_ you the freedom to complete what you _actually want to accomplish._

**You’re too busy _not_ to have structure.**
