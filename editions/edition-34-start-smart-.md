Stop.

Don’t rush into the week.

Don’t impulsively dive into whatever is top of mind.

Slow down just for a moment.

Pull up your goals from wherever you have them written down.

Read them over. Remember the reasons why.

From that, write down your priorities for the week.

And _now_…execute!

P.S. Did you just read through the above without actually doing it? Go back and do it now. Seriously!
