Focus isn’t just more important than genius—genius is _useless_ without it.

What’s more, genius isn’t _necessary_ with focus.

So, if you’re a genius, you still need to build the discipline to focus.

If you’re not a genius, you can still succeed as long as you learn to focus.

This is good news for most of us, even if it’s easier said than done.

Focus is a muscle.

You can strengthen it over time.

No genius required.
