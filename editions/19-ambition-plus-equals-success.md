Ambitious goals are a spark that gets you moving.

But ambitious goals alone won't sustain your motivation.

You can't create discipline just by setting an exciting goal.

Excitement ebbs and flows; you can't rely on it for consistent progress.

**Discipline is a habit you strengthen through practice.**

The effort is worth it: when you combine ambition with discipline, you achieve bigger things.
