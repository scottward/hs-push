When you get disappointing results from someone on your team, it is easy to suspect a character flaw. It feels like they should have done better.

We treat ourselves the same way. When we fall short on something, we feel like it reflects poorly on our discipline, our level of organization, or our abilities.

When you feel disappointed in yourself or someone else, slow down and take a moment to check the system. Often, a flawed system is to blame, not the person.

**The most common flaw? Relying on willpower and memory instead of building automation and habits.**

For example, leaders set strategic goals for themselves and their team but stop there. The weekly execution of those goals depends on everyone remembering them and mustering the willpower to work on them. Without a proper system, everyone finds it hard to stay goal-focused.

If you want consistent performance, invest in optimizing the system with automation and habit formation so that it requires as little willpower and memory as possible.

**Good people with a good system are unstoppable.**
