As your business grows, so must your habits as a leader.

For example, there’s a certain set of habits that serve founders well as they grow their company from 0 to 1M in Annual Recurring Revenue. They need to be scrappy, intuitive, and execute key tasks directly.

A _different_ set of habits is required from the founder and the leadership team to grow from 1M to 5M in ARR. They need to be strategizing longer-term, developing leaders, and establishing systems.

Clinging to outdated habits causes friction and holds the company back.

Are your habits driving growth or dragging you down? Ask your team. 😉
