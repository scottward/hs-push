"Accountability" is not about scolding yourself or others. It is not about a person's character.

It is about facts. It is transparently _accounting_ for what you planned to do vs. what actually happened.

It is taking responsibility to put in the work to win, even if you can't completely control the end results.

It is a commitment to reflect and learn from your misses without recasting them as successes.

It is about being honest with ourselves, not about being perfect.
