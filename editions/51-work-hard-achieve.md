Everyone feels at times like they are “working hard and achieving little”.

Other times, it feels like we’re making big strides and we’re actually not.

So, how can we assess how we’re doing? Whether our feelings match reality?

Don’t rely on emotions to judge your progress.

Why? Because our feelings swing up and down in response to all kinds of unrelated inputs.

They’re a poor gauge of progress.

Some recommendations:

- Set objective milestones that you can measure yourself against.

- Include input and learning goals, not just outcomes like revenue.

- Remind yourself that if you persist, you will prevail.

Bottom line: Feel what you feel, but judge your progress by evidence, not emotion.
