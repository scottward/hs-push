Remember that the goals you’re pursuing are the _solution_, not the problem.

You may be tired.

You may be hard pressed on all sides by your infinite to-do list.

You may feel like working on something more fun.

Skipping your strategic work won’t solve any of this.

It will only _prolong the suffering._

The _solution_ is to achieve your goals.

So…plan and execute your strategic work this week!
