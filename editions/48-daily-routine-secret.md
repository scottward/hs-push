Think about the small actions you repeat every day.

Project those years, or even decades, into the future.

What are the likely long-term results of those habits?

Now consider the small things you _don’t_ do consistently.

Extrapolate those omissions decades into the future.

What will be the likely long term results?

If some of the projections don’t sit well with you, don’t panic.

Just pick something very small you’d like to change.

Now cut it in half. Make it tiny.

Write it down.

Tell someone else about it to get a boost through accountability.

Focus on making that one change.

Don’t move on to another habit until the first one is solidly embedded.

You need to focus on making small changes.

And you need to keep trying, forever, despite all the setbacks.

If you do, over time, you’ll align your daily routine with the future you want.

"The secret of your future is hidden in your daily routine."
— Mike Murdock

Think about the small actions you repeat every day.

Project those years, or even decades, into the future.

What are the likely long-term results of those habits?

Now consider the small things you don’t do consistently.

Extrapolate those omissions decades into the future.

What will be the likely long term results?

If some of the projections don’t sit well with you, don’t panic.

Just pick something very small you’d like to change.

Now cut it in half. Make it tiny.

Write it down. 

Tell someone else about it to get a boost through accountability.

Focus on making that one change.

Don’t move on to another habit until the first one is solidly embedded.

You need to focus on making small changes.

And you need to keep trying, forever, despite all the setbacks.

If you do, over time, you’ll align your daily routine with the future you want.
