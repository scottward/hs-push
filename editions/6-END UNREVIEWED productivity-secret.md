What’s the secret to working on the right thing?

Use a system that helps you to reflect more deeply, but less often.

For goodness’ sake don’t leave the question, “What should I do now?” to an in-the-moment instinct that gets yanked around by your emotions.

Set an annual goal and break it down to the quarter and month.

Plan your week according to your monthly priorities.

When you think, 'What should I be doing right now?' **don't start reflecting.**

If you have to spend energy thinking about your next strategic action, you'll likely skip to something easier and more immediately gratifying.

Don’t think.

Just pull up your pre-planned weekly actions, and get busy.
