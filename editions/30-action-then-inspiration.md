Famous novelist Peter de Vries said, _"I write when I'm inspired, and I see to it that I'm inspired at nine o'clock every morning."_

The point they're both making is that if we wait to do important work until we feel inspired, our progress will be sporadic. We'll struggle to put in the hours necessary to succeed. We really do need to sit down and get to work regardless of how we feel.

**But that doesn't mean we should power through like robots and ignore our need for inspiration.**

It just means that we need to _get started_ even if we aren't feeling it.

Getting started usually kickstarts our internal momentum. **We start to feel inspired _after_ we start the work.**

The trick is to make the very first step scripted and mechanical and easy. For example, I often don't feel like writing, but I have a document with links to the 7 browser tabs I need open when I write an article. When I'm feeling the resistance, I just say to myself, "Just open the tabs".

Once I do that, I usually feel a twinge of motivation. And before I know it, I'm writing and I'm not even thinking about whether I'm feeling inspired (which means I am).

In short: discipline yourself to regularly get started on your most important work no matter how you feel, trusting that inspiration will arrive to carry you on.
