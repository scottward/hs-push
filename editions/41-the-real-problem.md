Actually, “lack of direction” is NOT usually the problem.

The more common problem is **overabundance** of possible directions.

When you have more than three “priorities”, overwhelm kicks in hard.

The solution is to set yearly goals and break them down to the quarter, then to the month, then to the week.

When you add an additional goal midstream, force yourself to remove an old one. Don’t just implicitly add more goals to your mental list!

Chunking goals down plus keeping the list small gives you just the right amount of direction to stay productive.
