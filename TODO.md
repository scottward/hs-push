## Post Text Formatting Task

* Read @README.md and @QUICKSTART.md
* Then process editions 21-40 as per the detailed instructions below.
* Check off the editions as you go under Editions Checklist Below.

### Detailed Instructions

For each edition file, update the `## Post Text` section to be LinkedIn-ready:

1. **Verify the quote** - Ensure the quoted text matches `quote_text` from the front matter exactly
2. **Verify/fix the author** - Ensure the author line is formatted as `— Author Name` (em dash, space, name) and matches `quote_author` from the front matter
3. **Add blank line** - There should be one blank line between the author line and the body text
4. **Copy Email Content** - Take the content from `## Email Content` section and copy it below the author
5. **Remove markdown** - Strip any markdown formatting (`_italics_`, `**bold**`, links, etc.) so it's plain text
6. **Format for readability** - Each paragraph or numbered point should be on its own line with blank lines between for LinkedIn readability

### Example

**Before:**
```
## Post Text

"Quote here"
— Author Name

Long blob of text all on one line with no breaks 1️⃣ point one 2️⃣ point two etc...
```

**After:**
```
## Post Text

"Quote here"
— Author Name

First paragraph of content.

Next paragraph.

Final paragraph.
```
